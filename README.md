# Epicycle Drawing In Python
Python implementation of Drawing With Fourier Epicycles, based on Coding Train Tutorial by Daniel Shiffman:
https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/130.3-fourier-transform-drawing.html

Uses drawing coordinate extraction algorithm from Randy Olson:

In addition to the tutorials above I would highly recommend the Welch Labs Imaginary Numbers Are Real YouTube series.
